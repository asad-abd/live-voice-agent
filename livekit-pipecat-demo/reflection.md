# Assignment Reflection

## What Is Built

This demo successfully implements a complete **real-time voice agent** using LiveKit and Pipecat. The system achieves all assignment requirements: LiveKit handles WebRTC media transport, Pipecat orchestrates the AI pipeline with Deepgram STT, the agent implements echo+modify responses ("...got it" suffix), barge-in interruption works properly, and latency measurement is tracked and displayed. The React client provides a clean interface showing conversation transcripts and speaking indicators.

## Technical Assessment  

**LiveKit** excels as robust media infrastructure - it handles WebRTC complexities, scaling, and network resilience excellently. **Pipecat** provides an elegant agent framework with declarative pipelines and built-in AI service integrations. However, the combination creates architectural complexity: multiple services (Docker, Python, React), external API dependencies (Deepgram), and multi-hop latency. For production, this stack works well for sophisticated voice AI applications, but simpler alternatives like WebSocket + OpenAI Realtime API might be better for basic use cases where this complexity isn't justified.
